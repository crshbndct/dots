This is a place where I keep various scripts and files that I use to keep my gentoo system running.
Some of the scripts were made by ChatGPT.
I know absolutely nothing about programming.
If you use these scripts, you WILL lose data. 
I'd love for someone to have a look at the photo sorting one, since it managed to sort 370,000 photos in under an hour, on a HDD.
